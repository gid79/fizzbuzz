Simple implementation of the FizzBuzz problem:

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and
 for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

To build and test:

> mvn clean package

Run the FizzBuzz application:

> java -cp target/fizzbuzz-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.logicalpractice.fizzbuzz.FizzBuzz
